movekey
=======

Karabiner mappings for moving the cursor.

Hold down your movekey and use WASD to move; I have it set up as Q/E to <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd>+<kbd>← Left</kbd> and <kbd>⌥ Option</kbd>+<kbd>→ Right</kbd>, Caps/F for <kbd>⌃ Control</kbd>+<kbd>A</kbd> and <kbd>⌃ Control</kbd>+<kbd>E</kbd>. My movekey is semicolon.

### What?

Get [Karabiner](https://pqrs.org/osx/karabiner/index.html.en). Change your private.xml to this:

    <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
    <root>
        <import path="movekey.xml" />
    </root>
    
And put movekey.xml in the same directory. Activate Karabiner and check the boxes.

### Why?

Because I did it and it's too late to quit now.

Seriously, use these *at your own risk*. You get a little too used to them after a while. If you type on another computer, be prepared to see a lot;q\*;f* of weird things like that.
